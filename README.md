This project focuses on predicting U.S. airline departure delays using extensive flight, weather, and operational data spanning over three million records. Key predictors include aircraft age, concurrent flights reflecting airport congestion, precipitation levels indicating weather conditions, scheduled departure time blocks, and airline carriers. Logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests were applied to classify delays exceeding 15 minutes. Logistic regression offered the most interpretable insights with an AUC of 0.64, highlighting significant factors like precipitation and congestion, while random forests achieved the highest accuracy (~82%) by capturing non-linear relationships despite some limitations in sensitivity.
The analysis revealed that adverse weather, especially precipitation, significantly increases delay likelihood, alongside airport congestion and carrier-specific operational differencesâ€”Delta Airlines showed comparatively fewer delays. Evening departure times also correlated with higher delays, emphasizing temporal patterns. Despite challenges like class imbalance and data size, these findings provide actionable insights for airlines to optimize scheduling, improve passenger communication, and enhance operational efficiency. Future improvements could include balancing techniques and more advanced ensemble models to further boost prediction performance and practical utility.
